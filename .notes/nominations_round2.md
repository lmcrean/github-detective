# Round 2 Top 3 Issue Nominations

**Selection Criteria for Round 2**: Maximum viability - issues that can be realistically completed with high confidence of success.

---

## ðŸ¥‡ First Choice: stripe-stripe-go #2092
**Issue**: Missing .Metadata field for BankAccountCreateParams  
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-11  
**Repository**: stripe/stripe-go (65 total issues)

### Why This Is Extremely Viable

**1. Crystal Clear Scope**
- Single missing field in a struct
- Exact field name known: `.Metadata`
- Clear target: `BankAccountCreateParams`
- No ambiguity about what needs to be implemented

**2. Established Pattern**
- Stripe Go SDK already has metadata fields in dozens of other parameter structs
- Can copy exact implementation pattern from similar structs (e.g., `CustomerCreateParams.Metadata`)
- No new architectural decisions required

**3. Low Risk Implementation**
- Adding a field to a struct is non-breaking
- Zero impact on existing functionality
- Simple JSON tag addition: `Metadata map[string]string \`json:"metadata"\``

**4. Immediate Testability**
- Can verify fix by attempting to set metadata on bank account creation
- API will either accept or reject the field - clear success/failure indicator
- Existing test patterns can be copied for metadata fields

**5. Recent Activity = Maintainer Attention**
- Updated August 11, 2025 (very recent)
- Shows active maintainer engagement
- High likelihood of quick review and merge

## ðŸ¥ˆ Second Choice: stripe-stripe-go #2093
**Issue**: Unable to create BankAccount  
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-11  
**Repository**: stripe/stripe-go (65 total issues)

### Why This Is Highly Viable

**1. Well-Defined Bug**
- Clear error symptom: URL parsing issue
- Specific API endpoint affected: BankAccount creation
- Error is reproducible and documented

**2. URL Parsing = Common Fix Pattern**
- URL construction bugs are well-understood problems
- Likely involves fixing path parameters or endpoint formatting
- Can compare with working similar endpoints in same codebase

**3. Clear Success Criteria**
- Fix succeeds when BankAccount creation API call works
- Binary outcome: either the API call succeeds or it doesn't
- No subjective judgment required

**4. Active Issue Status**
- Also updated August 11, 2025
- Part of same recent activity wave as #2092
- Suggests coordinated attention to BankAccount functionality

**5. Isolated Impact**
- Fix affects only BankAccount creation endpoint
- Won't break other functionality
- Safe to implement and test independently

## ðŸ¥‰ Third Choice: mastercard-flow #999
**Issue**: Fix mermaid compatibility  
**Last Updated**: 2024-11-19  
**Repository**: mastercard/flow (27 total issues)

### Why This Is Solidly Viable

**1. Dependency Version Bump**
- Classic software engineering task: update vulnerable dependency
- Clear action: upgrade mermaid to compatible version
- Success = dependency updated + tests pass

**2. Security Motivation**
- Security vulnerability fixes are high-priority for maintainers
- Clear business justification for accepting the change
- Reduces organizational security debt

**3. Established Resolution Pattern**
- Dependency upgrades follow standard process:
  1. Update version in build file
  2. Fix any breaking API changes
  3. Run tests
  4. Verify security issue is resolved

**4. Contained Scope**
- Changes limited to mermaid usage within the project
- Breaking changes (if any) are documented in mermaid's changelog
- Can be incrementally tested

**5. Clear Verification**
- Security scanners will confirm vulnerability is resolved
- Existing functionality either works or breaks (binary outcome)
- Can run full test suite to verify compatibility

## Why These Beat Other Options

**Compared to NVIDIA CCCL Issues**:
- NVIDIA issues require deep CUDA/GPU knowledge
- Performance optimization needs specialized testing infrastructure
- Memory management bugs need advanced debugging skills

**Compared to Container Toolkit Issues**:
- Container runtime issues require complex testing environments
- System-level integration problems are hard to reproduce
- CDI specification knowledge is highly specialized

**Compared to React Stripe Issues**:
- Frontend bugs often involve browser-specific behavior
- Accessibility fixes require specialized testing tools
- Cross-platform compatibility testing is complex

**These top 3 win because**:
- **Clear success criteria**: You know exactly when you're done
- **Low knowledge barriers**: Standard software engineering skills apply
- **Minimal dependencies**: Don't need specialized testing infrastructure
- **Recent activity**: Maintainers are actively engaged
- **Isolated scope**: Changes won't cascade into other system components
