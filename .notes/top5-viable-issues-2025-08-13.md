2. **Move to Tapioca ActiveRecordColumnTypes** - has maintainer buy-in
3. **Tackle Roast STDIN support** - clean feature implementation
4. **Implement Stripe Ruby headers** - good learning experience
5. **Finish with Stripe Go OpenTelemetry** - most complex but highest impact

### Development Environment Setup

**Tapioca:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shopify/tapioca
bundle install
# Review: manual/compiler_activerecordcolumns.md
```

**Flash-List:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shopify/flash-list
npm install
