 we are now going to use the github api to pull these issues in this format:                                


 # input

 c:\Projects\github-library\data\repos\shopify_stripe_filter3.csv


this is a list of github repos
 # method

 use scripts/

 # output file structure

 data/issues/{{date(yy)}}/{{date(mm)}}/{{date(dd)_org(3-chars)_repo(10-chars)_issue(15-chars)}}.md

 e.g.
 data/issues/25/08/14_str_stripe-node_configuring-erro.md

# output detail
