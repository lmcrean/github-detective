Hello Stripe team,

Iâ€™m using the Stripe Terminal SDK (@stripe/stripe-terminal-react-native@^0.0.1-beta.16) on two devices:

Device 1: Android version 12

Device 2: Android version 15

On Android 12, the WisePad 3 disconnects automatically when the app is killed, which is expected.

However, on Android 15, the terminal remains connected even after the app is killed. This behavior is inconsistent and seems to be related to changes in Android 15.

Could you please help me understand or resolve this issue?

Thank you!
