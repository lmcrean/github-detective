I'm wondering if we could create a new mixed option that is between nilable and untyped. If the only reason we mark columns as 'untyped' is non-nil fields might be nilable before save, there's no actual reason that truly nilable columns should be untyped. 

I'm proposing a `ActiveRecordColumnTypes` called `mixed`:
- Non-nil fields continue to be untyped
- Nilable fields get typed consistently with `persisted` mode.


Another possible name might be `untyped-only`

I think it's a good step between `untyped` and `nilable` üëç

Do you want to take a stab at it?
