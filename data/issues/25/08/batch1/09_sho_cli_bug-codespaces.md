- [x] Reproduced the issue in [the latest CLI version](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shopify/cli).

### In which of these areas are you experiencing a problem?

App

### Expected behavior

`shopify app dev` should work correctly in a Codespaces environment.

### Actual behavior

The Shopify embedded app iframe shows "github.com refused to connect." The error message is:

```
Refused to frame 'https://github.com/' because an ancestor violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "frame-ancestors 'none'".
```

The root cause seems to be that GitHub auth cookies have `SameSite=Lax`, so the iframe will never see them.

I can work around it with `CODESPACE_NAME= pnpm exec shopify app dev` to force a Cloudflare tunnel (side note, I'd love a better way to configure the tunnel).

### Verbose output

N/A

### Reproduction steps

1. Start the embedded app template in Codespaces.
2. Run `shopify app dev` and open the preview URL.
