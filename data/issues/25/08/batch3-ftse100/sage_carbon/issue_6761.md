issue title: Badge Component Styling Issues
}

issue description:
### Description

The Badge component looks to have fallen out of sync with the Design System, original message: 

I've been playing around with the Badge component used with an icon and have some questions around styling. It doesn't seem like we have much control over the size/positioning of the component, is there anything we can do to adjust it? I've included a StackBlitz example below that shows a couple of cases but neither look particularly good and would need some adjustment. The example also shows what appears to be an issue when rendering the badge within a menu item/popover container, with the same components rendering differently than those outside the menu. Finally, is there any way to change the background colour of the badge or will this always be white? Thanks!

  Hi @Sage-AlanYoung üëãüèº Currently, we don't provide the ability to amend the sizing or position of `Badge`. Looking at the latest version of Design System, it seems Carbon's `Badge` has a few discrepancies with the DS, so we will need to review these and make the necessary changes.
