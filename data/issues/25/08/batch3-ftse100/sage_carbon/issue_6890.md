May I check what styling you expect to see when the logo in the demo is focused? Have you received any specific designs for this? We assume the logo would require the standard gold focus ring, similar to this example:

  @Parsium I feel GlobalHeader wouldn't comfortably support the double focus ring. Since space is tight in this case a much thinner focus style might be more appropriate?

  @harpalsingh Hey, would you be able to take a look at this and advise on what the focus border should look like. Thanks!

  @nineteen88 yep so this is the expectation of the focus on a logo visula, so its an internal version of the double border:
