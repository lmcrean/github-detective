# Sage Carbon Issues Analysis - Not Worth Pursuing

## Summary
These issues are UI/Frontend developer tasks, not software engineering challenges.

## Why These Aren't Worth Your Time

### Low Complexity
- Routine React/CSS fixes (event bubbling, ref forwarding, focus traps)
- Junior dev or AI-solvable problems
- No algorithmic or architectural challenges

### High Replaceability & Automation Risk
- Thousands of devs can fix these
- AI tools (Copilot, Cursor, Claude) already handle these patterns
- UI component work is prime target for automation
- Frontend roles being cut first in current market

### Zero Career ROI
- Won't differentiate you in job market
- No transferable hard skills
- Component library maintenance = dead-end work

## What to Focus on Instead
- **Backend/Systems** - Hard to automate, requires deep understanding
- **Performance Engineering** - Scale, profiling, architecture
- **Security** - Vulnerabilities, cryptography, secure design  
- **Data/ML Ops** - Pipelines, distributed systems
- **Infrastructure** - K8s, cloud architecture, observability
- **Domain Expertise** - Fintech, healthcare, embedded

## The Reality Check
In 6-12 months, AI will auto-fix these Carbon issues. The market is flooded with frontend devs. These trivial UI updates offer zero career advancement.

**Decision: SKIP THESE ISSUES - Focus on harder, non-automatable problems**
