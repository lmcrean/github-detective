issue title: Ability to add custom data role for Children of the Menu Segment Title
}

issue description:
### Description

I need to ability to target the Children of a Menu Segment Title via a data-role in order to add custom styling.
At the moment it has a generic data-role of `menu-segment-children` and isn't exposed as a prop to use.

### Suggested solution

Add the ability to expose a custom data-role for consumers to use.
