### In which of these areas are you experiencing a problem?

Theme

### Expected behavior

Hello,

When I create a zip for a theme, when I send the zip to the theme store, I am facing the following error:

<img width="2038" height="256" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4ac83e9-8945-4923-b8c3-23090448be11" />

The strange thing is that the `/listings` folder is here, it contains the folder for each preset. If I generate manually the zip using OSX archive tool, it works. I've compared the two zip (the one generated by Shopify CLI and the one I generate manually), they are exactly the same.

Even weirder, if I take the archive generated by Shopify CLI, extract it and recreate it manually, it works, confirming that all the files are here.

It seems to me that it might be an encoding issue of Shopify CLI when generating the `/listings` folder. I can't really publish the zip here as our theme is not open source, but if someone from Shopify could send me a DM on Slack (I'm bakura10) so I can send them the archive, that would help.

### Actual behavior

It didn't work
