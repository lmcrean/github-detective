### What area(s) will this request affect?

App

### What type of change do you want to see?

New feature

### Overview

Not sure why, but `metafieldNamespaces` and `metafields` props of webhook susbcriptions aren't available when setting up webhooks via the app toml.

Per this page, these options are missing: https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/cli-for-apps/app-configuration#webhooks

They're available via graphql admin API:
https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/input-objects/WebhookSubscriptionInput

Weirdly, the Remix template does support `metafieldNamespaces` for it's `registerWebhooks` function, but it doesn't support `filters` - so neither toml or `registerWebhooks` can be used to create a webhook subscription with a filter on metafields.

Any plans to support these options in toml webhook subscription definitions?

### Motivation

Need to create a webhook subscription that filters on a product metafield value in a public app. TOML is the easiest way to do this and I'd like to avoid manually creating these on install via graphql mutation (and then having to keep them up to date with manual jobs to update existing stores if things change).
