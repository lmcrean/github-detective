### In which of these areas are you experiencing a problem?

Theme

### Expected behavior

My scripts file (`http://127.0.0.1:9292/cdn/shop/t/23/compiled_assets/scripts.js?<some number>`) not to have a syntax error.

### Actual behavior

My scripts file (`http://127.0.0.1:9292/cdn/shop/t/23/compiled_assets/scripts.js?<some number>`) has a syntax error. It is missing a trailing `})();`.

### Verbose output

The log output of `shopify theme dev` does not have any errors. The `Console` tab on the browser reveals the syntax error.

### Reproduction steps

I don't know under which conditions this occurs but it occurs with my theme. You can go to store ID `dbstdz-9k` and try to develop the master branch locally to reveal the issue. It works without any issues on live or when previewed using Shopify Admin. However, when developing locally using `shopify theme dev`, the issue occurs. More details are as follows:

Since Friday, I started getting weird behaviors when developing locally using Shopify CLI. Today I investigated the issue and discovered that there is an error log for the scripts file (`http://127.0.0.1:9292/cdn/shop/t/23/compiled_assets/scripts.js?<some number>`). Investigating it further revealed that the file has a syntax error: It is missing a final `})();`.

I monkey patched the issue by going to the `handleBlockScriptsJs` function at `/Users/username/.nvm/versions/node/v24.1.0/lib/node_modules/@shopify/cli/dist/index.js` and adding another `javascripts.push("})();");` line right after the already existing `javascripts.push("})();");` line. This fixed the issue for me locally.
