**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
[Shopify/theme-graph](https://github.com/Shopify/theme-tools/pull/956) allowed each file to be able to tell if it has a reference or dependency to another file.

There is currently a command you can run in VSCode to tell you if you have orphaned files.

It would be nice if on start-up an prompt appears at the bottom of VSCode to tell you to remove orphaned files.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
- Need a nice way of telling the developer when they have orphaned files that isn't hidden in VSCode
