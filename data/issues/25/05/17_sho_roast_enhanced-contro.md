# Enhanced Control Flow for Roast Workflows

## Background

Roast workflows currently support basic sequential execution and parallelism through nested step arrays. However, more complex automation requires additional control flow mechanisms such as conditionals, loops, and dynamic branching to handle varying scenarios and iterative processes.

## Problem Statement

Workflows often need to make decisions based on previous outputs, repeat operations until a condition is met, or skip certain steps conditionally. The current workflow structure lacks these capabilities, limiting the complexity and adaptability of automation that can be built with Roast.

## Proposed Solutions

This epic covers several control flow enhancements:

1. **Conditional Execution** - Adding if/unless support for branching based on conditions
2. **Iteration Mechanisms** - Implementing loops and collection iteration capabilities
3. **Early Exit and Skip Controls** - Providing mechanisms to terminate early or skip steps
4. **Dynamic Step Selection** - Supporting switch/case style dynamic execution paths
5. **Parameterized Subroutines** - Enabling reusable step patterns with arguments

These enhancements will significantly expand Roast's capabilities, allowing for more sophisticated, adaptive, and robust workflows while maintaining its declarative nature.

## Implementation Considerations

1. **Workflow State Management** - Extend state repository to track loop iterations and condition states
2. **Execution Engine Enhancements** - Modify WorkflowExecutor to handle control structures
3. **Variable Scope Management** - Define variable scope within control structures
4. **Schema Extensions** - Update JSON schema to validate new control flow elements
5. **Error Handling** - Implement robust error handling for control flow issues

See child issues for the detailed implementation plans for each feature.
