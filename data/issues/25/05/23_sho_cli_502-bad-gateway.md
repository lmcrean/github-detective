I have the exact same error here. Log output identical to @reeswell.  

- WSL 2 on Windows 10
- @shopify/cli/3.80.7 wsl-x64 node-v24.1.0

Removing a plugin through `shopify plugin reset` solved the issue for me.

Thank you for your response. However, when I tried `shopify plugins reset`, it shows "Found 0 plugin" and the issue still persists.

Here's what I've tried:
1. Ran `shopify plugins reset` -> Result: "Found 0 plugin"
2. Completely uninstalled and reinstalled Shopify CLI
3. Cleared npm cache and configurations

My environment:
- WSL 2 on Windows 11
- @shopify/cli/3.53.0
- Node.js v22.15.1
- - Theme: Liquid theme

Do you have docs for the SHOPIFY_HTTP_PROXY? Couldn't find anything.

Looks l like a CLI core/kit issue
