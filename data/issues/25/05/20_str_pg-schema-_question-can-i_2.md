description:
As far as I've seen, you can only compare full databases. What I would want to do is comparing 2 schemas with different names.

For instance, say we have **schemaA** and **schemaB**, and in the **schemaA** we have a table `schemaA.test` that doesn't exist in **schemaB**.
Calling `Generate()` would return something like: `CREATE TABLE schemaB.test (...);`

Is this possible currently? And if not, is this something you have in mind for an eventually coming release?

Thanks! ðŸ‘‹
