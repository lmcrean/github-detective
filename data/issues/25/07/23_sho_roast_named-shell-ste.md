description:
A step like `- clear_files: $(rm -rf some/file)` does not appear in the run output, or the ActiveSupport::Notification payload as "clear_files", instead the whole command is its "name":
```
% bundle exec roast execute ci-coverage
ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ Everyone loves a good roast ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

Starting workflow...
...
Executing: $(rm -rf some/file) (Resource type: none)
```
