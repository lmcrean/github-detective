### In which of these areas are you experiencing a problem?

Theme

### Expected behavior

Changes from main branch on connected github repository should be pushed to live main theme

### Actual behavior

We are trying to push changes to our live theme from a connected github repository, however when pushing we are getting a bunch of error messages in the theme log of "Validation failed: The total size of templates in blocks, config, layout, snippets, templates, locales, sections exceeds 250MB" when looking at the theme folder sizes it is only ~180mb so not sure why we are getting the error

ðŸ‘‹ Hey @NiickFenske,

The fix for this issue won't live on Shopify CLI, since it actually comes from the Shopify APIâ€™s validation for asset uploads.

I've already reported this to the appropriate team. Once they update the Shopify validations, youâ€™ll see an update here.

Thank you for reporting this.
