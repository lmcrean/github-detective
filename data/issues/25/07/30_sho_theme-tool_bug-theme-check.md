### In which of these areas are you experiencing a problem?

Theme

### Expected behavior

- When you run `shopify theme check` I want to see all the theme-checks that show up in VSCode


### Actual behavior

- LiquidDoc error **does** show up when its within the same file
- Cross-file LiquidDoc errors (like when one is referenced via `render` or `content_for` tag do not show up)

NOTE: This only happened on my Windows, but it works on my Mac

### Verbose output

- not needed

### Reproduction steps

1. Create a snippet with LiquidDoc with at least 1 required param
2. Render that snippet, without passing in the required args
3. See the error in VSCode
4. Run `shopify theme check` and notice it does not appear in the logs
