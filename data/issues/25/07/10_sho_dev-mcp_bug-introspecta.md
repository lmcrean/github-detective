### Bug Report: introspect_admin_schema tool missing or inaccessible schema file

**Description:**
When running the `introspect_admin_schema` tool with correct arguments, it fails due to the missing or inaccessible schema file at `/app/data/admin_schema_2025-01.json`.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Run the tool with example arguments:
   ```
   introspect_admin_schema --conversationId example-conversation-id --filter all --query product
   ```
2. Observe the error related to the missing or permission denied schema file.

**Expected Behavior:**
The tool should successfully access the schema file and perform introspection.

**Environment:**
- Repository: https://github.com/Shopify/dev-mcp
- Tool: introspect_admin_schema
- Schema file path: `/app/data/admin_schema_2025-01.json`
- Tool Version: Docker MCP Toolkit version
