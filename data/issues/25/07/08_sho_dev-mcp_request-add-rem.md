description:
My team uses Claude extensively, and has been having great success with [Remote MCP servers](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/11176164-pre-built-integrations-using-remote-mcp) -- Asana, Zapier, Square in particular.

I'd like to add Shopify to that list so that (authorized) users can query the API from Claude as part of larger tasks.

Installing a local server and maintaining it is too much to ask of my team - they're not programmers, they need a set-and-forget solution. If Shopify can host a remote server, then I can help them get it set up one time and then not worry about it ever again - auto updating, no troubleshooting, "just works".

Thanks folks!
