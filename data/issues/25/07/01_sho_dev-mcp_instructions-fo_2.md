description:
I'd like to know how this works with Copilot. I'd love to not be an old dinosaur with no idea how to get the most from MCP, but there's scant documentation and no indication how _how_ to actually use it to get benefit.  If docs don't yet exist, can you create; if they do exist, where can they be found?
